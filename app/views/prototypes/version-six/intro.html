                <p>Access to data is governed by the Unity Catalog solution in Databricks. Data is organised in the following hierarchy:</p>
                <p>A place to administer data access that apply across all workspaces.</p>
                <p>In Unity Catalog, the hierarchy of primary data objects flows from metastore to table:</p>

                <p><STRONG>Metastore</STRONG>: The top-level container for metadata. Each metastore uses a three-level name (catalog.schema.table) that organizes your data.<br>
                  <p>Example: <STRONG>preprod_catalog_p02.ada_demo.csc_data</STRONG></p>
<p><img src="/public/images/data-path4.png" class="app-notebook-image"></p>
                  <STRONG>Catalog:</STRONG> The first layer of the object hierarchy, used to organize your data assets.<br><br>
                  <STRONG>Schema:</STRONG> Also known as databases, schemas are the second layer of the object hierarchy and contain tables and views.<br><br>

                 <p>Cells use the default language of the notebook but you can prime cells for different programming languages using magic commands. Magic commands allow you to switch between Python, SQL and R.</p>
